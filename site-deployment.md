## What is hosting?

Put your files somewhere so people on the internet can access them

---

## What is a server?

* A computer that runs special software that we put our website files on
* Typically has better ventilation, tested and reliable parts, hot swappable hard drives, few “frills”.
* You can build one, but we mostly rely on companies that have data centers dedicated to making sure servers are stable using staff and other technology to maintain them.

## Hosting - Shared

* Definition: Many websites exist on a single server. That servers resources (Processor, RAM, Disk Space) are shared among them.
* Pros: Cheap
* Cons:  Not easily scalable if website experiences higher traffic

---

## Hosting - Dedicated
* Definition:  Lease an entire server, so you are not competing for resources with other websites.
* Pros: More flexible, because you have a choice of operating system and hardware.
* Cons: Expensive

---

## Hosting - VPS (Virtual Private Server)
* Definition: Like shared hosting, a VPS is one large server, but it is virtually portioned into chunks that act as their own server.
* Pros: Better resource allocation than shared hosting, easily scalable
* Cons: Expensive, More complicated

---

## Hosting - Cloud
* Definition: Runs on a series of servers
* Pros: Better stability, easily scalable
* Cons: Expensive, More complicated
